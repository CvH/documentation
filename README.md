# Introduction

LibreELEC is a 'Just enough OS' Linux distro for running Kodi mediacentre. Our goal is to ensure the distro is well documented with clear and simple instructions on how to install, configure, and build, LibreELEC images. These pages are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/LibreELEC/documentation) allowing you to add/edit the content.
